# dressfinder.py
Dressfinderapi.py achieves the original intent of matching dresses from Threadflip.com by specified sizes, measured in inches.

This version of dressfinder uses Threadflip.com's API, found with Firefox developer tools. The script no longer has trouble accessing url's/content/information generated client-side.
